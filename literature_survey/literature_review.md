# Literature Survey

## Satellite-AI Cloud Platform for Climate Risk and Flood Prediction

## Overview

A literature survey was conducted to understand recent advances in flood prediction using satellite imagery, artificial intelligence, remote sensing, cloud computing, and weather forecasting. Nine recent research papers (2023–2025) from reputed journals and conferences were reviewed to identify existing techniques, limitations, and research gaps.

Water, 16(12), 1670.** | Applies Vision Transformers to Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery for flood detection, capturing long-range spatial dependencies and outperforming CNN-based methods, especially in heterogeneous terrain. | Focuses only on image classification; does not integrate meteorological data, cloud deployment, real-time inference, or automated disaster response. |

## Key Findings

- Most studies use satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 SAR and/or Sentinel-2 optical) as the primary data source for flood detection and mapping.
- Deep learning architectures such as CNNs, U-Net, U-Net++, DeepLabV3+, and Vision Transformers consistently improve flood detection and segmentation accuracy over classical threshold-based methods.
- Several studies combine remote sensing with terrain, hydrological, or Bayesian uncertainty models to improve robustness and generalization to unforeseen flood events.
- Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Grad-CAM and HiResCAM are emerging tools to improve trust and interpretability of deep learning flood models.
- Very few works integrate satellite imagery, weather APIs, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, dashboards, authentication, and automated alerts into a single deployable platform.
- Cloud-native, real-time architectures for continuous flood monitoring and early warning remain limited across the reviewed literature.

## Identified Research Gap

Existing research primarily focuses on developing accurate flood detection or prediction models in isolation. However, there is limited work on building an end-to-end cloud platform that continuously collects satellite imagery and weather data, performs AI-based flood prediction with uncertainty quantification, stores results, visualizes flood-risk information through an interactive dashboard, and provides automated notifications to users.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed project, **Satellite-AI Cloud Platform for Climate Risk and Flood Prediction**, addresses these limitations by integrating:

- NASA–IEEE GRSS Flood Dataset
- OpenWeather API
- AWS cloud services
- Machine learning–based flood prediction
- Interactive web dashboard
- Secure user authentication
- Automated flood alerts
- Cloud monitoring and logging
